# Hi, I'm Fardeen 👋

**MSc Digital Finance & Banking** @ University College London  
**BSc Computer Science** @ King's College London

I'm passionate about building intelligent systems at the intersection of **AI/ML and finance**. Currently exploring applications in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and decentralized systems.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- **AI-Powered Fundamental Analyst Agent** - Automated financial analysis tool that downloads data, calculates ratios, performs DCF valuation, and generates investment memos using GPT-4
- **Quantitative Finance Projects** - Applying machine learning to financial markets and trading strategies

## 💼 Experience

**Software Engineer Intern** @ N2N Connect Berhad  
Built mobile/tablet app for 10-location restaurant chain using Flutter, implementing multilingual support and workflow optimization features.

## 🚀 Featured Projects


### [Integrated Investment Management System](https://github.com/FardeenIdrus/master-analyst-agent)
- Orchestrates multi-agent architecture combining specialized quantitative, fundamental, and macroeconomic analysts through JSON-based communication protocol to replicate institutional investment committee workflows
- Implements weighted consensus mechanism that dynamically adjusts influence of each analytical perspective based on current market regime, historical accuracy, and confidence intervals
- Synthesizes conflicting signals across technical momentum indicators, discounted cash flow valuations, and economic cycle positioning into unified buy/hold/sell recommendations with conviction scores
- Aggregates risk metrics from component agents including Value-at-Risk, maximum drawdown projections, correlation matrices, and sector exposure concentrations for portfolio-level risk management
- Generates comprehensive investment committee memos with dissenting viewpoints, sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios, and explicit reasoning chains explaining final capital allocation decisions
- Applies hierarchical decision framework: individual agent outputs → cross-validation layer → risk overlay → final portfolio construction with position sizing and rebalancing triggers
**Tech:** Python, LangChain, multi-agent coordination, Claude Sonnet 4, JSON orchestration, pandas, custom integration layer, asyncio

### [Quantitative Alpha Engine](https://github.com/FardeenIdrus/Technical-Analyst-Agent)
- Implements 10-factor momentum and mean-reversion framework using RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, and moving average crossovers with weighted confluence scoring to generate high-conviction signals
- Detects market regimes through Hurst Exponent analysis (distinguishing trending vs. mean-reverting environments) and variance changepoint detection to adapt strategy behavior dynamically
- Validates edge through walk-forward optimization across 10 years of historical data, then stress-tests with 1,000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation using block bootstrap resampling to measure statistical robustness
- Optimizes capital deployment via fractional Kelly Criterion combined with GARCH(1,1) volatility forecasting to maximize risk-adjusted returns while preventing over-leverage
Generates institutional-grade investment memos with multi-scenario forward analysis, risk attribution, and drawdown projections powered by large language models
- **Tech:** Python, VectorBT, yfinance, pandas, scipy, statsmodels, Anthropic/OpenAI API, ReportLab

### [LiverWise - Healthcare App](https://github.com/FardeenIdrus/LiverWise)
- Two-sided platform connecting healthcare professionals with patients for liver disease education
- Led 10-developer team, delivered ahead of schedule
- Real-time messaging and forum features using Firebase
- **Tech:** Flutter, Firebase, Cross-platform iOS/Android

### [Autonomous Patrol Robot](https://github.com/FardeenIdrus/PatrolRobot)
- Computer vision-based rule enforcement robot using YOLOv4 object detection
- Autonomous multi-room navigation with SMACH state machines
- **Tech:** ROS, Python, YOLOv4, AMCL, Move Base

### [Consent Model Simulation Tool](https://github.com/FardeenIdrus/consent_visualisation_tool)
*Recommended for publication by dissertation supervisor*
- Flutter app evaluating user preferences for digital privacy consent models
- Conducted research with 30+ academic papers and user study with 10 participants
- Proposed novel hybrid consent model addressing gaps in messaging platform privacy
- **Tech:** Flutter, Dart, MVC Architecture, Real-time State Management

### [Video Editing DSL](https://github.com/FardeenIdrus/EDL_DSML)
- Domain-specific language for video editing with automatic EDL generation
- Built complete language toolchain using Xtext framework
- **Tech:** Xtext, EMF, ANTLR, Java, Xtend
